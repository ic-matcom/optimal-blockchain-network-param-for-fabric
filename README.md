Optimal blockchain network param based on analysis of Hyperledger Fabric performance

Hyperledger fabric is a popular choice for enterprise use cases and a top blockchain protocol for private permissioned blockchain implementation. But, unlike the public blockchain networks like Ethereum, setting up a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network is a complicated task. It is crucial for your network/application performance and even breaks the purpose of using blockchain itself. All these challenges call for a proper evaluation of various factors before you start deploying hyperledger fabric in blockchain network.
